    <!-- NEW SECTION: What is a Climograph? -->
    <section class="info-section">
    <h2>What is a Climograph?</h2>
    <p>
        A <strong>climograph</strong> (also known as a climatic diagram) is a single graphical chart that displays the basic climate of a specific location. It serves as a powerful tool for geographers, meteorologists, and students to visualize the long-term weather patterns of a region, specifically focusing on two key variables: <strong>temperature</strong> and <strong>precipitation</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike a standard weather forecast that tells you what will happen tomorrow, a climograph represents averages usually collected over a period of 30 years. This data helps define the "climate personality" of a city, determining whether it belongs to a tropical rainforest, a desert, or a tundra biome.
    </p>

    <h3>How to Read a Climograph</h3>
    <p>
        Reading these charts requires looking at three distinct axes simultaneously. Here is the breakdown of the visual components:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Bottom Axis (X-Axis):</strong> This represents the 12 months of the year, usually starting with January on the left and ending with December on the right. This allows you to track seasonal changes.</li>
        <li><strong>The Bar Graph (Blue):</strong> The vertical bars represent the average monthly <strong>precipitation</strong> (rainfall or snowfall). You read the height of these bars against the axis on one side (often the left), usually measured in millimeters (mm) or inches.</li>
        <li><strong>The Line Graph (Red):</strong> The continuous line hovering over the bars represents the average monthly <strong>temperature</strong>. You read the points on this line against the axis on the opposite side, measured in degrees Celsius (°C) or Fahrenheit (°F).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why Are They Important?</h3>
    <p>
        Climographs are essential for understanding the relationship between climate and human activity. For <strong>agriculture</strong>, knowing the "growing season" (the warm months) and the "wet season" is vital for planting crops. Farmers in a Monsoon climate, for example, rely on the heavy rains shown on the chart during summer months.
    </p>
    <p>
        They are also crucial for determining <strong>Global Climate Classification</strong>. The shape of the line and bars allows scientists to categorize a region using the Köppen system. A straight, flat temperature line typically indicates a tropical location near the equator, while a steep curve (like a bell shape) suggests a location in the Northern Hemisphere with hot summers and cold winters. Conversely, a "U-shaped" temperature line indicates a location in the Southern Hemisphere, where June and July are the coldest months of the year.
    </p>
    <p>
        By mastering the climograph, you aren't just looking at data; you are visualizing the rhythm of life in different corners of the Earth.

    <h2>What's Climograph Guesser?</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Climograph Guesser</strong> is a unique educational and competitive tool designed to test your climate analysis skills. It challenges you to interpret a presented climograph and accurately pinpoint its location on a world map.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike a simple guessing game, scoring is based on a rigorous quantitative method. This makes it highly suitable for competitive play, use in classrooms, or for deepening personal understanding of global climate patterns.
    </p>

    <h3>How the Game Works</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Goal:</strong> To place a pin on the world map at the location whose actual climate best matches the presented climograph.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> Your score is calculated based on the similarity between the climate data of the location you pin and the data shown in the target climograph.</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h3>The Scoring Mechanism (Quantitative Approach)</h3>
    <p>
        The Climograph Guesser system uses advanced similarity calculations to objectively determine which two locations on Earth have the closest climate. The system treats the two key climate variables as 12-dimensional vectors.
    </p>

    <h4>1. Climate Data Vectorization</h4>
    <p>
        The monthly average data for 12 months is represented by two distinct vectors:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Temperature Vector</strong> $\vec{T}$: The average temperature data for each month (Jan-Dec).
            $$\vec{T} = (T_{Jan}, T_{Feb}, T_{Mar}, \dots, T_{Dec})$$</li>
        <li><strong>Precipitation Vector</strong> $\vec{P}$: The average precipitation data for each month (Jan-Dec).
            $$\vec{P} = (P_{Jan}, P_{Feb}, P_{Mar}, \dots, P_{Dec})$$</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Similarity Calculation (Cosine Similarity)</h4>
    <p>
        We use Cosine Similarity $S(\vec{A}, \vec{B})$ to determine how closely the climate data pattern of the location you pin ($A$) aligns with the pattern of the target climograph ($B$). This measure is robust because it focuses on the pattern rather than the magnitude.
    </p>
    $$S(\vec{A}, \vec{B}) = \frac{\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B}}{\|\vec{A}\| \|\vec{B}\|}$$
    <p>
        This calculation is performed independently for both the temperature and precipitation vectors. This method is exceptionally superior from a metrological perspective because it correctly handles regions with very low precipitation, such as deserts, where a slight measurement error could lead to a large absolute difference. Cosine similarity ensures the "pattern" (e.g., near-zero precipitation all year) is accurately assessed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The final score is a weighted integration of these temperature and precipitation similarities, normalized to a maximum of 100 points.
    </p>
